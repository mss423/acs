Algorithm: The algorithm entity. It contains algorithms (e.g., decision trees) and models (e.g, CNN and LSTM). Algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
Examples: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, CNN, LSTM, RNN, gradient descent
