# Core dependencies for the project

pandas>=1.3.0         # For data manipulation (reading CSVs, DataFrames)
torch>=1.8.0          # PyTorch backend (required by simpletransformers)
simpletransformers>=0.63.0 # Main library for model training and prediction
scikit-learn>=0.24.0  # For evaluation metrics (classification_report, accuracy) and potentially stratified sampling
numpy>=1.19.0         # Numerical operations (often a dependency)

# Optional, but recommended:
# tensorboard         # For logging if using default simpletransformers logging
# wandb               # For logging if using Weights & Biases integration

# Note: Specific versions might be required based on your CUDA version or other libraries.
# It's recommended to create a virtual environment and run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
# after installing the necessary packages to capture exact versions.
